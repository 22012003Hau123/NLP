Text Similarity Comparison Tool using Tkinter
This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to compare text similarity using Tkinter. It utilizes libraries such as Tkinter for GUI development, sklearn for text processing (TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity), and nltk for text tokenization (sent_tokenize, word_tokenize).

Features:
Sentence and Word Tokenization: Uses nltk to tokenize sentences and words from input texts.
Matching Sentences: Identifies and displays sentences that are identical between the input text and a comparison corpus.
Matching Words: Finds and shows common words between the input text and comparison corpus.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Computes the cosine similarity between the input text and comparison corpus.
Interactive GUI: Provides a user-friendly interface with text input areas, a button to trigger comparison, and labels to display results.
